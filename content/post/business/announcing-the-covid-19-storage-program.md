By now the whole world has felt the daily impact of COVID-19. Everyone at Storj Labs wants to try to help with pandemic relief efforts in any way we can. That's why we're proud to announce the COVID-19 Storage Program

The last things people on the frontlines of COVID-19 research should have to worry about are cloud storage and egress costs, or data security, privacy, and availability. So,Â  if you or your organization are working to fight the global pandemic, Storj will provide you with 1TB of free cloud storage and bandwidth per month on the Tardigrade decentralized cloud storage platform for one year. We as a company are also committed to providing 5 PB of data and storage toward COVID-19 research, and we're open to considering requests beyond the 1TB offer.

If you want to see if you qualify, simply head over to our COVID-19 Storage Program page to sign up today. Registration is a simple, self-certification process.

Stay safe and healthy---we can't wait to be less decentralized, well, in person that is.

Sincerely,

Ben Golub
Executive Chairman and Interim CEO at Storj Labs
