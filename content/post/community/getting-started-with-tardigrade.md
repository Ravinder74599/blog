Tardigrade is accessible for developers of all levels, and you can get the hang of it in an afternoon. If you're accustomed to working in the command line it will be even faster. You should start with the tutorial "How to Upload your First Object with Tardigrade" (see the embedded video at the bottom of this post). Once you have some data in the cloud, check out our bindings and connectors in the language of your choice, to interact with the data you're storing.

### Exploring Tardigrade

Tardigrade is extremely easy for developers to get started with, and the learning curve is not steep. The first steps occur in the browser, after which you're free to do everything else via the command line. (The reason for that is security—since end-to-end encryption is baked-in by default we never expose or even see your keys.) Once you've created an API key, you can switch to your choice of command line tools, on any OS. Our documentation offers samples or Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Getting up to speed with Uplink CLI is a quick process. If you're accustomed to AWS already, it will feel very familiar—even the commands are the same.

I've attached a short 5-minute video tutorial to demonstrate the process of creating a project and API key, and then uploading objects into a bucket.
